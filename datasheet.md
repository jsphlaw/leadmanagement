# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

X Education aims to improve its lead conversion rate by identifying the most potential leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads,' thereby increasing the efficiency of the sales process.

 
## Composition

The dataset comprises various attributes related to leads, including prospect ID, lead numbers, lead origin, lead source, customer preferences (Do Not Email, Do Not Call), customer activity metrics (TotalVisits, Total Time Spent on Website, Page Views Per Visit), customer details (country, specialization, occupation), referral sources, customer preferences, lead quality indicators, and activity indices.

## Collection process

Data is collected from various sources including website interactions, lead forms, referral sources, and customer interactions with the sales team.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Labeling involves identifying 'Hot Leads' based on historical conversion data.
 
## Uses

The model assigns a lead score to each lead, indicating the likelihood of conversion. This enables the sales team to prioritize leads with higher scores, thereby increasing the lead conversion rate.

## Distribution

The model and associated data are distributed internally within X Education to the sales and marketing teams responsible for lead management.

## Maintenance

Regular updates to the model are necessary to incorporate new data and improve predictive accuracy. Maintenance involves monitoring model performance, retraining with new data, and updating features as needed.
