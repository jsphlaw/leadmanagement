## **Intent to buy Lead Prediction**

## Project Overview**
There are various marketing touchpoints or paths a buyer encounter on their path to purchase. In fact, according to Flaherty, T. (2023) “there are on average 27 different communication touch points before a deal is won”. This becomes even more difficult when dealing with an account (company) rather than an individual. Marketing is responsible for running various campaigns across multiple channels to generate leads that potentially get converted into won opportunities by Sales. How can marketing as a function effectively measure its value contribution to the organisation in an industry where 78% of generated revenue comes from existing client's through (cross sell and upsell) Flaherty, T. (2023)?

Why Machine Learning

Currently the industry wide adopted process is as shown below.

Marketing is responsible for lead generation and nurturing.
Manual Lead scoring-based system to apportion points to leads based on engagement levels.
Sales to receive leads from that achieved a scoring threshold from marketing.
Sales to create opportunities and close deals.
This is a linear process that does not consider existing client’s and that around 82% of buying decisions are made up of buying groups (3 or more making buying decisions for a business) thereby underestimating marketing value contribution (Flaherty, 2023).

A model that predicts purchase intent from downstream marketing activities and customer segment is needed to attribute multiple marketing effort against an opportunity.
